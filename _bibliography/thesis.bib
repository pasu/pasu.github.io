    abstract={We present a gradient domain method for volume rendering using the Metropolis Light Transport algorithm. Our method computes the gradient of the light path in the medium, taking into account medium properties, including transmittance, phase function, and the geometry factor. We use this gradient to estimate the radiance of mutated paths at a negligible cost. Furthermore, we propose a gradient mutation strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into Multiplexed Metropolis Light Transport (MMLT) to exploit path correlation in the medium. We demonstrate that our method yields a superior result compared to MMLT alone.}
