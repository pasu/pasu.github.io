abstract={Efficient and precise texture filtering is essential in various applications. However, there is often a trade-off between coarse real-time approximations and accurate computationally-expensive supersampling. We introduce a novel efficient texture-filtering method over arbitrary quadrilateral footprints, achieving high accuracy at a low computational cost. We achieve this by pre-computing integration tables that sparsely sample the space of possible footprints. Finally, we compare the qualitative and computational performance of our method to commonly used techniques and demonstrate various applications for high-quality real-time image synthesis, including normal filtering, soft shadow mapping, and glint rendering.}
