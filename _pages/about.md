Hello, I am Guowei, you can also call me Peter. I’m a PhD student at [CGV](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/). My research focuses primarily on real-time rendering, realistic material, global illumination and VR. In addition, I am interested in differentiable/neural rendering.

I got my MSc with honours in Computer Science (Informatica), Game and Media Technology programme from Utrecht University in the summer of 2020.

Next to my studies, I worked as a 3D GIS engineer in R&D department at SuperMap, focusing on productions related to virtual earth and map.
