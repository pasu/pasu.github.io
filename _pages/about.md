Iâ€™m a PhD student at [CGV](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/). My research focuses primarily on real-time rendering, realistic material, global illumination and VR rendering. In addition, I am interested in offline/differentiable rendering.

I got my MSc with honours in Computer Science (Informatica), Game and Media Technology programme from Utrecht University in the summer of 2020.
