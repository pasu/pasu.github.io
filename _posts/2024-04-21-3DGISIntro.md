> A geographic information system (GIS) is a system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. GIS connects data to a map, integrating location data (where things are) with all types of descriptive information (what things are like there). This provides a foundation for mapping and analysis that is used in science and almost every industry. GIS helps users understand patterns, relationships, and geographic context. The benefits include improved communication and efficiency as well as better management and decision making.

当谈到GIS时，我们在谈论一种技术，它结合了地理信息（Geographic，如地球表面的特征和位置）和信息系统（information system, 计算机软件/硬件/数据库），用于收集、存储、处理、分析和可视化地理空间数据。
