pbrt-v4 plays a pivotal role in my research endeavors. Recognizing that my C++ proficiency requires modernization, I view this state-of-the-art open-source project as an ideal platform to enhance my skills in contemporary C++ practices. This series aims to document and share that journey.

### The Evolution of pbrt-v4

The journey began with Matt Pharr's keynote, "Porting pbrt to the GPU While Preserving its Soul," presented at HPG 2020 [1]. This talk illuminated the integration of modern C++ techniques within pbrt, including advanced memory management, polymorphic memory resources (pmr), and tagged dispatch for efficient polymorphism.

Modern C++ represents a paradigm shift from earlier iterations, such as C++98, with consistent updates every three years culminating in C++23. Features like `std::optional`, lambdas, `std::move`, and `std::thread` simplify development and enhance robustness. For inspiration, I recommend the article "Remember the Vase!" by C++ founder Bjarne Stroustrup, who advises: "Work hard on a solid foundation, learn from experience, and don’t scrimp on testing" [2]. Personally, working with the pbrt project offers a hands-on avenue to practice these concepts. Adopting modern C++ isn't merely about acquiring new skills but also shedding outdated practices, such as over-reliance on `new` and raw pointers—a transformation that makes modern C++ feel like "C+" in essence.

Moreover, modern C++ is a comprehensive solution for streamlining development and collaboration. It encompasses sophisticated build systems and project layouts (e.g., **CMake**), robust dependency management tools (e.g., **vcpkg** or **Conan**), continuous integration systems (e.g., **GitHub Actions**), and advanced IDEs (e.g., **VS Code**, **Visual Studio**, **CLion**) augmented by powerful AI tools like GitHub Copilot.

### Why Learn Modern C++ Through pbrt-v4?

#### Key Attributes of pbrt-v4

- Approximately 72,000 lines of modular, portable C++ code.
- A design philosophy that balances pedagogical clarity with computational performance.
- Implementation leveraging **C++17**, with features such as tagged dispatch, polymorphic memory allocation, and GPU-centric paradigms.

#### Rationale for Employing pbrt-v4 as a Learning Platform

1. **A Codebase Exemplifying Advanced C++ Constructs**

   - The architecture integrates state-of-the-art programming techniques, including:
     - Template metaprogramming for abstraction and reusability.
     - `std::optional` and `std::variant` for robust, type-safe data manipulation.
     - Polymorphic memory allocators (`std::pmr`) optimized for GPU interoperability, showcasing unified memory allocation strategies.

2. **Tagged Dispatch as a Paradigm of Polymorphism**

   - Supplanting conventional virtual functions, pbrt-v4 employs tagged dispatch, minimizing runtime overhead while enhancing GPU compatibility. Tagged pointers facilitate efficient, type-safe polymorphism by leveraging compile-time type resolution.

3. **Practical Implementation in High-Performance Contexts**

   - The project exemplifies how modern C++ constructs elevate both maintainability and computational efficiency.
   - Memory allocators (`std::pmr`) harmonize resource management across CPU and GPU domains, underscoring their adaptability in complex systems.
   - Tagged dispatch obviates the limitations of virtual functions, presenting a streamlined approach to polymorphism that is both performant and architecturally sound.
   - The design embodies the nuanced decision-making required to develop scalable, high-performance systems.

4. **Integration of Graphics Programming Principles**

   - The framework provides a deep dive into the intricacies of rendering pipelines, mathematical modeling, and parallel computation, all realized through idiomatic C++.

### Conclusion

I began learning programming in high school in 2000. As a financially constrained student, I purchased two second-hand books: one on basic programming and another titled C++程序设计 by 谭浩强. My mother, despite our limited means, invested around 8000 RMB in a computer for me. Unfortunately, my first attempt to set up a Turbo C environment resulted in the computer breaking down. Consequently, I couldn’t program on it, but I cherish memories of playing the video game Sword and Fairy (仙剑奇侠传 98) with my sister on that machine.

My initial motivation to become a programmer stemmed from a desire to prove that the computer was a worthwhile investment, justifying the significant financial sacrifice my mother made.

Proficiency in modern C++ is indispensable for engineers and researchers striving to create scalable, efficient, and robust applications, particularly in performance-critical domains such as computer graphics.

Have fun!
